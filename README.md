A fun musical and shapes JavaScript practice tool. Built for Coding Bootcamp. 

Hitting different keys on your keyboard allows for a variety of sounds and shapes/colros to appear on screen. Like a drum machine, but more fun! 

Next on the list, changing shapes and fading in and out, as well as changing sounds depending on keys pressed. This will be an item for my portfolio once completed.
